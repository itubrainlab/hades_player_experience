# Hades Frustration Tolerance Study
## FTQ
The FTQ folder contains data from the Frustration Tolerance Quistionnaire which consists of the BIS/BAS [Carver & White, 1994] and FNR [Wright, Lam, & Brown, 2009] scales.  

The BIS/BAS Scales measure sensitivity to motivational systems. BIS (behavioral inhibition system) relates to motivation to avoid aversive outcomes and BAS (behavioral activation system) relates to motivation to approach goal-oriented outcomes. BIS/BAS has four subscales: 
- BIS, which measures the likeliness to avoid aversive outcomes.
- BAS Drive, which measures persistency in pursuit of goals.
- BAS Reward Responsiveness, which measures the reaction to the expectation of reward.
- BAS Fun Seeking, which measures the willingness to approach potential reward spontaneously.

The FNR Scale measures lowered approach motivation following nonreward.  
## GEQ
The GEQ folder contains data from the Game Experience Questionnaire [IJsselsteijn, Kort, & Poels, 2013].
## All_scores.csv
The All_scores.csv file contains all the scores of both the BIS/BAS/FNR and GEQ questionnaires.
## HR Data
The HR Data folder contains the heart rate data collected during Play Session of all the players. The heart rate monitor used was the Polar H10.
